# Ovi-Store-Downloader-GUI
A GUI for WunderWungiel's Ovi Store Downloader.
Warning! My program comes with an outdated version of Ovi Store Downloader! Please update it yourself. Just download the files from https://github.com/WunderWungiel/Ovi-Store-Downloader and replace the files.
Also, you need to install pyqt6, requests and colorama for the program to work (pip install pyqt6 requests colorama).
To run it, open oviGUI.exe if you are on Windows. On Linux you open a terminal in the folder where you store the program and execute python3 ./oviGUI.py
